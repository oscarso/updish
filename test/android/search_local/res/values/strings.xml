<string name="main_activity_prompt">
This test application has a number of activities
that test search functionality. Use menu to invoke 
other test activities dedicated for this test application.
\n\n
The menu that is clicked is logged here in the debug area.
\n\n
Clicking on the search key, if it is enabled, doesn\'t do
anything. It calls the onSearchRequested(). you can see this
in the log file. But no global search will be called.

    <string name="local_search_enabled_activity_prompt">
This is a very simple activity that has indicated through 
the manifest file that there is a an associated search
activity. This activity invokes onSearchRequested()
when it detects a search either through a menu item
or a button click. 
Call to onSearchRequested() will result in a local search 
as opposed to global search.
\n\n
You can see the local nature of it by looking at the 
label of the QSB and also the hint in the QSB. Both
came from the search metadata.
\n\n
There are 2 ways to invoke local search from here.
\n\n
1. Click menu to see a search menu item
2. Or if search key is enabled clicke the search key
\n\n
Both ooperations will invoke the local search box.
Type something into the search box and hit the 
enter button to go to the search results activity.

<string name="actionbar_activity_prompt">
This activity demos the actionbar. You will see a search icon
show up in the action bar. if there is space
you will see a searchview as well.
\n\n
If there is not enough space, it may not present the
searchview but just the icon. In that case you have to
capture the menu and invoke search explicitly.
